## Overview
Stashhub is a compact, local-first Flask application for visually arranging folders and saved entries. Each entry can include a cover image, link, and freeform notes and is stored in a plain JSON file so data remains portable and easy to back up. The user interface emphasizes quick visual navigation and lightweight bookmarking for personal collections.

## Features
- Create and organize folders and entries with drag-and-drop style UI.
- Cover images per entry for visual identification.
- Attach links and free-text notes to any entry.
- All data persisted in human-readable JSON files.
- Local-first operation. No external DB required.
- Simple import/export and backup via the JSON files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or newer installed.
- pip available for installing Python packages.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository (or alternatively head to the Releases section and download the latest zip):

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-directory>
```
2. Start the app. You can run the provided helper scripts or run the main module directly:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
chmod +x ./run.sh
./run.sh
```

```bash
# Windows
run.bat
```

3. Open the app in your browser at:

```

### Uninstall

If you only want to remove user data, delete the JSON data files created by the app. By default these are located in:

```bash
./Files/
```
